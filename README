The Slim Milo Affair is a jQuery-based effect library for doing an automated
slideshow in a style inspired to the Pablo Ferro style used in "The Thomas
Crown Affair" (1968). Each slide has a main image which fades in, followed
by a series of horizontal and vertical bars sliding in over the main image.
The box areas defined by the bars are then filled with small subimages sliding
in. The whole area then fades out and is followed by the next slide fading in.

For the moment, the only usage instructions are here:
